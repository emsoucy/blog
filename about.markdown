### My Name is Ethan
- I am attracted to computers, books, and music.
- I am repelled by TV, social media, and cell phones.

I love technology but strive to stay out of the attention-economy, ad-driven, dystopian cycle of social media/phone addiction. Somebody wise once said, "if content is not worth paying for then it is not worth your time" and it stuck.

I am currently looking for a software engineering role. I have spent most of my career writing C/C++ in Linux and Windows environments but lately I have been experimenting with HTML, CSS, and React.
