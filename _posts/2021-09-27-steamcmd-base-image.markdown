Many developers on Steam provide dedicated server software that can be used by
players to host their own multiplayer games. The
[```steamcmd```](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) tool can be
used to fetch the server software from Steam. This command-line tool allows
users to connect to Steam, download, and install dedicated server software. For
this post I will be describing my process of building a container base image
with the SteamCMD tool preinstalled.

## Requirements

One of the main concerns of running any Internet connected server is security.
To minimize the security footprint, and learn along the way, I will be building
this image from scratch with a very minimal set of software. The image should be
designed for rootless opearation with as few privileges as possible. To further
isolate the server from the host, containers derived from this image will use an
unprivileged user inside of the container itself.

For this project, I will be using [```podman```](https://podman.io/) and
[```buildah```](https://buildah.io/).

## Creating the SteamCMD base image

In order to download dedicated servers from Steam, I need the
[```steamcmd```](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) command.
Using the Valve-provided instructions on ```steamcmd```, I wrote a build script
adapting the instructions to fit my own requirements.

The build script is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -o errexit

# Vars
CONTAINER=$(buildah from --ulimit nofile=2048 scratch)
MOUNTPOINT=$(buildah mount $CONTAINER)

URL='https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd_linux.tar.gz'
STEAM=/home/steam/steamcmd
VER=$(egrep '^VERSION_ID' /etc/os-release | cut -d '=' -f2)

# Install dependencies
if [ $(command -v 'dnf') ]; then
  dnf install -y --installroot $MOUNTPOINT --releasever $VER \
    SDL2.i686 SDL2.x86_64 coreutils glibc-langpack-en glibc.i686 \
    libstdc++.i686 --nodocs --refresh --setopt install_weak_deps=False
  rm -rf $MOUNTPOINT/var/cache/dnf
else
  echo "Build script requires dnf package manager. Exiting."
  exit 1;
fi

# Create steam user
mkdir $MOUNTPOINT/home/steam
echo 'steam:x:1000:1000::/home/steam:/bin/bash' >> $MOUNTPOINT/etc/passwd
echo 'steam:x:1000:' >> $MOUNTPOINT/etc/group
echo "PATH=\$PATH:$STEAM" >> $MOUNTPOINT/home/steam/.bashrc
buildah config --user steam:steam $CONTAINER
buildah config --workingdir '/home/steam' $CONTAINER

# Get steamcmd, unpack, and update
mkdir $MOUNTPOINT$STEAM
wget -qO- $URL | tar xvzf - -C $MOUNTPOINT$STEAM
chmod -R 700 $MOUNTPOINT/home/steam
chown -R 1000:1000 $MOUNTPOINT/home/steam
buildah run $CONTAINER -- sh \
  -c "$STEAM/steamcmd.sh +login anonymous validate +exit"

buildah unmount $CONTAINER
buildah commit --squash $CONTAINER steamcmd 
```

The script mounts an empty image and then uses ```dnf``` package manager to
install packages into the root of the mounted container. This way I do not need
to include a package manager inside of the container, my host's package manager
installs the packages into the container. I then create the ```steam``` user and
make the required changes to ```/etc/passwd``` and ```/etc/group```. Next I
download and unpack the ```steamcmd``` files into the container and run it so
that it will download and update the latest Steam files. Lastly the script
squashes and commits the image.

Building and listing the image:

```console
$ buildah unshare bash build.sh 
$ podman image list
REPOSITORY                  TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED        SIZE
docker.io/emsoucy/steamcmd  latest      7a82922e0390  3 minutes ago  346 MB
```

Installing a game:

```console
$ podman run -it steamcmd bash
bash-5.1$ steamcmd.sh +login anonymous +app_update <app id> validate +exit
```
