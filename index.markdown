I'm a software engineer from Woonsocket, RI now residing in Nashua, NH. I'd like to use this space to talk about my interests or things that I am working on.

I am currently looking for a software engineering role. I have spent most of my career writing C/C++ in Linux and Windows environments but lately I have been experimenting with Nodejs, React, and MongoDB.
