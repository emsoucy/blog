I'm a software engineer from Woonsocket, RI now residing in Nashua, NH. I'd like to use this space to talk about my interests or things that I am working on.

I am currently looking for a software engineering opportunities. Most of my experience is in C/C++, and Perl but I am currently fascinated by automated deployment and containerization. I feel the most at home working in a Linux Environment.
