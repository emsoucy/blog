I developed an early interest in computers thanks to the patience and encouragement of my parents. Watching my father disassemble the family PC, a Zeos brand 90MHz Pentium, was as if an entire world had revealed itself to me.

Most of my experience is in C/C++, and Perl but I am currently fascinated by automated deployment and containerization. I feel the most at home working in a Linux Environment.
